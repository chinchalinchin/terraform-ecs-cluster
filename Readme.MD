## Usage
Provide useage instructions and sample implementation. I.E. 

To use this module, you will need to include it in your terraform (or run it standalone) and pass the required variables, like so:


```hcl
module "canary_external" {
  # Reference the canary repository directly
  # source                = "git::https://github.boozallencsn.com/FRB-SRE/canary-external.git"
  # Reference the canary repository locally
  source                     = "../../"
  target_service             = var.target_service
  region                     = var.region
  target_urls                = var.target_urls
  enable_active_tracing      = var.enable_active_tracing
  canary_role_arn            = var.canary_role_arn
  canary_vpc_config          = var.canary_vpc_config
  vpc_access_policy          = var.vpc_access_policy
  evaluation_periods         = var.evaluation_periods
  period                     = var.period
  threshold                  = var.threshold
  email_endpoints            = var.email_endpoints
  canary_timeout             = var.canary_timeout
  canary_schedule_expression = var.canary_schedule_expression
}
```

## Project Background (What is... Ansible playbook, or Synthetic Monitoring, Or Prisma) 

X-Project serves the purpose of X,Y,Z. 

This module ahcieves X,Y,Z with by implementing A,B,C. 

## Important Design Decision #1 

This module is configured to... do something that may be a 'gotcha'... because of reasopns X, Y, Z

To disable this.....

## Important Design Decision #2

This module intergates with AWS Cloudwatch and......

## USe-Case specific Example

To deploy this module in _some state_ you need to configure X,Y,Z.P lease review the example below...  

*Example of a deployment in a VPC* 
```
canary_vpc_config = { 
   subnet_ids         = ["subnet-123xyz"], 
   security_group_ids = ["sg-123xyz"] 
} 
```

*Example of a deployment outside of a VPC* 
```
Canary_vpc_config = { 
} 
```

See the examples/use_case_1 folder to see a complete example.

## How to use variables to Modify some attribute 

You have the option of configuring this module for your needs by changing the X,Y,Z variable base don your use-case..... See an exampel below.....

*Example schedule for canary to run every 2 minutes with a 2 minute timeout*
```
canary_timeout = 120
canary_schedule_expression = "rate(2 minutes)"
```


## Development guide

Any values that aren't expected to be changed may be left hardcoded but all other values should be replaced with variables. 

The .devcontainer folder in this repository is setup to simplify development and manual running of this module. The Dockerfile contains all requires software to run the pre-commit hooks as well as terraform and the awscli.

*How to run pre-commit*
```bash
pre-commit run -a
pre-commit run <hook id> -a
pre-commit run terraform-docs-system -a
# If you desire to install pre-commit hooks to be triggered pre-commit (to not allow commits to be made unless all checks pass):
pre-commit install
```

Pre-commit will only verify terraform formatting, to actually apply terraform formatting, run:

```bash
terraform fmt --recursive
```

.buildspec.yaml is for AWS CodeBuild.
